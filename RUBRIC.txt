The application asks the user to sign in and shows a 404 page if that poll does not exist. 

(In other words, if a user creates a poll and then the same or another user tries to access that poll by its url,

the user should be asked to sign in and then be shown a 404 page.

Please keep in mind that new polls will not be accessible at their url because of the way the backend is set up in this application.)

The voting mechanism works correctly, and the data on the leaderboard changes appropriately.

The form is available at/add.
Upon submitting the form, a new poll is created and the user is taken to the home page.
The new polling question appears in the correct category on the home page.


Each userâ€™s answer and each new poll is correctly recorded on the backend.
